All our major field campaigns are part of the [Ecological Fractal
Network](https://ecofracnetwork.github.io/) that we founded and
maintain. Our collaborators have established sites on every continent
bar Antarctica, and we have established >10 sites within the UK. There
are, however, two sites that are perhaps closest to our hearts as they
were the first established sites within the network!

### 'Right-Hand Fork', Utah

Our fieldsites are located approximately 40 minutes drive from Utah
State University on the Right-Hand Fork of the Logan River (although
it has been pointed out to us it could be argued to be a left-hand
fork, the name has now stuck!). They span roughly 1000 feet of
elevational change, and include rangeland, sagebrush-steppe, and
sub-alpine habitats. This variety makes them ideal for studying all
sorts of ecological assembly processes, even if the terrain is
sometimes a little tough on the knees...

### Silwood Park, UK ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/silwood-park.jpg){: style="width: 300px; float: right; border: 10px"}

Imperial College London's green jewel, Silwood Park is where we spend
most of our time when we're in the office, and is the perfect place to
test new survey techniques. It's also quite a nice place for a beer at
the end of a long day's work...
