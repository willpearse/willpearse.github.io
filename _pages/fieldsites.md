# Right-Hand Fork ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/rhf-map-2019.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; border: 10px"}

Our fieldsites are located approximately 40 minutes drive from campus
on the Right-Hand Fork of the Logan River. They span roughly 1000 feet
of elevational change, and include rangeland, sagebrush-steppe, and
sub-alpine habitats. This variety makes them ideal for studying all
sorts of ecological assembly processes, even if the terrain is
sometimes a little tough on the knees...

### Site design 

Our sites are arranged in a fractal design, and in 2017 we established
the core 27 1m x 1m plant survey plots ([with soil temperature
sensors](https://soiltemp.weebly.com)) in 2017. In 2018 we extended
the fractal 'in' to cover 81 sites, and took soil samples for texture
analysis and bacterial and fungal sequencing. In 2019, we extended the
sites 'out', surveying additional sites to cover gradients in grazing
and (starting next year) prescribed burns that will be carried out by
the Forest Service. We also began pilot work looking at the bee and
wasp communities at some of the sites. To complement these data, we
are also collecting plant functional trait and phylogenetic data.

### Future work ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/rhf-dayone.jpg){: style="width: 250px; float: right; border: 10px"}

As we continue to use our sites to understand the controls on
ecological community assembly in the area, we are also building in
more kinds of data. We would love to measure plant phenology at the
sites, or to expand our taxonomic coverage to include other taxa
(beetles? birds?) but right now we're a little limited by
person-power. [Perhaps you would like to help?...](/join)
